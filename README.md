# Snackchat (Horizons Hackathon Project)

Snackchat is a clone of the Snapchat mobile application which utilizes the GoogleVision API to make distinctions between items found in photos.  Much like Snapchat, our application allows users to take photos and send them to others but with a twist.  Snackchat only lets the user send the photo if it reconizes the main item in the photo to be food!
